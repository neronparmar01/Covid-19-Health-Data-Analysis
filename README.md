The dataset is in CSV format and includes the following columns:

## Analysis:
In this project I have done analysis of the above data in three parts one is the home page, second the death data cases, third the cases gettting registered. In the home page i have made the list of the country code through which a person can go through in easy detail of how much cases are registeres, how many cases of death took place and get insights, even can go through the year, month or date filters. For the other two pages the same thing is done but the map insight is also provided for the individual to get through details easily and convienient way. Moreover, you can even switch through the tabs by the buttons provided at the top of every pages for easy navigation. I hope this insights and data find you well suited to understand.
